          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p> The focus of scouting should be the boys and their experiences that help them grow. The idea behind Scout Charter is to lessen the administrative burden on leaders so they can provide such experiences for their scouts.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Volunteer driven</h3>
